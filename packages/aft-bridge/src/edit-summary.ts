// Shared, compact agent-facing summary for file-mutation tool results
// (edit / write / apply_patch). Both the OpenCode and Pi plugins
// render the SAME agent-facing text from this helper so the two harnesses stay
// in parity.
//
// Design (see session decision): the agent already supplied the path and the
// content it wants, so we do NOT echo the file path, the before/after content,
// or the raw Rust JSON envelope back to the model. Doing so makes the payload
// scale with file size, not edit size. The rich data (diff body, backup id,
// status-bar counts, etc.) stays in the plugin's UI `metadata`/`details`; the
// status-bar line is injected separately by the bridge layer.
//
// The model only needs: did it apply, how much changed (cheap confirmation),
// and any signal it must act on (rollback, no-op, format-skip, LSP errors).
